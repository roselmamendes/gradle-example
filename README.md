# Gradle Example

Project created in order to learn a bit about Gradle and add security dependencies check.

This project was created following this [tutorial](http://www.petrikainulainen.net/getting-started-with-gradle/) with some modifications due to out-of-date informations. So check this [link](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management) as well.

## Structure

I am using a java plugin for gradle `apply plugin: 'java'`.

The plugin requests the following project structure:

src

    main
        java
            package-level-1
            .
            .
            .
        resources
    test
        java

After to proceed with a clone, inside of the project's folder run `gradle test`.

To run the project use `java -jar build/libs/gradle-example.jar`.

Some interesting tasks that come with java plugin:

- **assemble**: just build the project (create a build folder with a jar file, .class files, etc) but it doesn't run tests;
- **build**: build and test the project;
- **test**: run tests.
